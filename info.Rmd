## PanomiX Documentation
The panomiX toolbox is developed using Shiny, a web application framework for R that allows for interactive data analysis and visualization. This interactive web-based platform allows to effortlessly analyze complex biological data across different omics layers, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics.
To ensure accessibility, panomiX is hosted on Shinyapps.io, a cloud-based hosting service for Shiny applications. This allows users to access the platform from anywhere without requiring additional infrastructure. Cloud deployment eliminates the need to manage local servers, providing a smoother user experience and easier maintenance.

## Data Input

### Accepted Data Formats
PanomiX works with continuous molecular data, including:
- **Normalized RNA-seq counts**
- **Protein abundances**
- **Metabolite concentrations**
- **FTIR spectra**

Your data should be structured as a **feature matrix**, where:
- **Columns** represent biological samples (e.g., individuals or time points)
- **Rows** represent molecular features (e.g., genes, proteins, metabolites, or spectral variables)

For regression tasks, a **continuous outcome variable (y)** is required. This can be any measurable quantitative trait.

### Uploading Data
PanomiX accepts data files in standard tabular formats such as **CSV**. Ensure that your dataset follows the structure above before uploading.

## Data Preprocessing and Recommendations
PanomiX can handle large datasets but benefits from preprocessing steps to improve performance:
- **Filter low-variability features** to remove those with minimal variation across samples.
- **Exclude low-count features** in sequencing data (e.g., RNA-seq), dropping consistently low-count features.
- **Remove near-zero variance features** that do not significantly contribute to the model.

Preprocessing helps reduce dataset size, minimize overfitting, and optimize the efficiency of machine learning models like **XGBoost**.

## Data Harmonization and Scaling

### Transcriptomics Data Normalization
PanomiX normalizes transcriptomic data to ensure consistency:
1. **Log transformation** stabilizes variance.
2. **Infinite values are filtered out** for numerical stability.
3. **Gene expression is centered** around its mean to reduce biases.
4. **Median scaling** corrects batch effects and extreme variations.
5. **Log-transformed values are reverted** to preserve biological relevance.

### FTIR Data Processing
FTIR spectral data is often affected by background noise. PanomiX applies:
1. **Baseline correction** using the baseline R library.
2. **Savitzky-Golay smoothing** using the signal R library to reduce high-frequency noise while preserving spectral features.

### Recommendations
- **Transcriptomics:** Upload a count matrix with raw counts or pre-normalized values (TPM/CPM).
- **FTIR Spectra:** Ensure absorbance values are compiled into a single matrix before processing.

## Component of Variance Analysis
Understanding variance in the data is critical for analysis. PanomiX offers:
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to examine variance patterns across omics datasets.
- **ANOVA-based variance estimation** to identify major variance components.

Before PCA, datasets are standardized to a **unit sum of squares** for uniformity. PanomiX supports:
- **Separate PCA** for each omics dataset to assess individual variance.
- **Integrated PCA** for multi-omics datasets to uncover global patterns.

### Recommendations
- **Normalize data** before PCA (PanomiX handles scaling automatically).
- **Provide metadata** with at least:
  - An **ID column** matching omics data.
  - **Experimental conditions** (e.g., condition1 and condition2).

## Multi-Omics Prediction with XGBoost
PanomiX leverages **XGBoost** for high-dimensional multi-omics data analysis. Information about XGBoost <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest//">here</a>.

### Data Splitting Options
Users can split datasets via:
- **Random splitting** (train/test ratio adjustable via slider).
- **Replicate-based splitting** (keeps replicates together for consistency).

### Hyperparameter Tuning
PanomiX automates tuning using the **caret package**. Key hyperparameters:
- **Tree depth (max_depth):** 3–6 (higher values risk overfitting).
- **Learning rate (eta):** 0.1–0.5 (lower rates improve accuracy).
- **Gamma (gamma):** 0.1–0.6 (higher values prevent minor splits).
- **Boosting rounds (n_estimators):** 50–1000.
- **Subsample (subsample):** 0.5–0.8 (reduces overfitting).
- **Column subsampling (colsample_bytree):** 0.5–0.8.
- **Regularization (alpha, lambda):** Default L1 = 0, L2 = 1.
- **Min child weight (min_child_weight):** 1–5 (avoids overly specific splits).

### Feature Importance & SHAP Analysis
- PanomiX ranks predictors using **feature importance scores**.
- **SHAP values** help interpret feature contributions.
- A **beeswarm plot** visualizes SHAP values for better insights.
- **Boruta-SHAP algorithm** is available for alternative feature selection.

### Recommendations
- **Use replicate-based splitting** for biological replicates.
- **Tune rounds and tree depth** in the cloud version.
- **Use cross-validation (CV) for generalization**; LOOCV is better for small datasets.
- **Analyze SHAP values** to interpret key predictors.

## Multi-Omics Interaction Analysis
PanomiX evaluates interactions between predicted and known features. Users can:
- **Provide a list of relevant known features** for model assessment.
- **Assess feature relationships** through SHAP values.

### Constraint-Based Modeling
- **Random Constraints:** Upload a table with two columns:
  - "feature"
  - "final_association" (all values set to **0** for unknown relationships).
- **Monotonic Constraints:** Upload a table with "feature" and "final_association" values:
  - **1** for a known positive relationship.
  - **-1** for a known negative relationship.
  - **0** for unknown relationships.

PanomiX incorporates constraints to align model predictions with biological knowledge.

### Recommendations
- **Provide metadata** for experimental conditions.
- **Use monotonic constraints** when relationships between features and outcomes are known.
- **Leverage SHAP-based feature interactions** for deeper insights into biological processes.
