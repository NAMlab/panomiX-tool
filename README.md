## Multi-omics Integration Framework- panomiX
A multi-omics shiny app likely refers to a web application developed using the Shiny framework in the R programming language for the analysis and visualization of multi-omics data. 

Let's break down: Multi-omics refers to the integration and analysis of various biological data types, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other -omics data. Combining these datasets can provide a more comprehensive understanding of biological systems and complex diseases.

Based on this, a "multi-omics shiny app" would likely be a user-friendly interface for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing integrated multi-omics data. Users might be able to upload their datasets, perform various analyses, and visualize results through interactive plots and dashboards. The app could potentially include features such as differential expression analysis, network analysis, and other tools commonly used in the analysis of multi-omics data.

## XGBoost App

This application enables users to build a predictive model using the XGBoost package and the caret package. It provides functionality to fine-tune the XGBoost model and select the optimal configuration through cross-validation, specifically employing a 5-fold cross-validation approach.
